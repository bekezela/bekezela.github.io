                During my spare time I like to read inspirational books, watch documentaries,hiking and particitape in some charity activities.One of the charity activities that I participated this year was summiting the Platterklip Gorge (Table Mountain) as many times as I could in one day. This yearly activity raises money for the orphanages that are in need. This year the athelets managed to raise over one million rands. The other charity event that I normally participate is the Biker`s Toy Run, were people bring toys for the orphanages. The recent book that I read is The monk who sold his ferrari by  Robin Sharma. The recent move I watched and really liked was Hidden Figures because it shows how women entered the technology Industry.
